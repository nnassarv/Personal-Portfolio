> ### Some of the updates include:
- Using Bootstrap as a CSS framework
- Update the portfolio projects to real assignments and projects
- Refactor the website


## Design
For this website I used a simple color pallet with contrasting colors and dark background.
The first version of the site was done completely with CSS.
The second version is done with **Bootstrap** to help make it ***mobile-first***

> ### Front-end tech
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome


## Mobile first
The first version of the website was made using media screens to make the app responsive to mobile or smaller screens. The second version addresses these requirements by leveraging Bootstrap's column + row framework.
