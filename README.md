#homework-week-2

## This week's homework is about creating my first web app from scratch..

The website is the first version of my portfolio. It will be updated and improved as the course goes on and I learn new technologies, frameworks, tricks, and other cool things.

Some of the links and images used for "my work" are placeholders and demo items. Real projects will be added as I create other homework and mini-projects.


### Design
For this website I tried using a simple color pallet with contrasting colors and dark background.


## Media Screen
A media screen has been defined at 700px width in order to enable flexibility for smaller screens / mobile devices.
