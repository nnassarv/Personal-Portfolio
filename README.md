#homework-week-2

## This week's homework is about creating my first web app from scratch..

### The website is the first version of my portfolio. It will be updated and improved as the course goes on and I learn new technologies, frameworks, tricks, and other cool things.

### Some of the links and images used for "my work" are placeholders and demo items. Real projects will be added as I create other homework and mini-projects.
