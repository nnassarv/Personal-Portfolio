#homework-week-2

**Note:** I had to change my folder structure into "/docs" because the site was deploying without the css styles. After some research, i found on stackoverflow that I can deploy from a "/docs" folder instead of main. This seemed to fix it. On the other hand, I was not able to keep the "/assets/css" and "/assets/images" structure as it is recommended in class.


## This week's homework is about creating my first web app from scratch.

The website is the first version of my portfolio. It will be updated and improved as the course goes on and I learn new technologies, frameworks, tricks, and other cool things.

Some of the links and images used for "my work" are placeholders and demo items. Real projects will be added as I create other homework and mini-projects.


## Design
For this website I tried using a simple color pallet with contrasting colors and dark background.

I also learned how to use a cdn and add it to my project so I can retrieve icons. In this case I integrated the font awesome cdn and I used some of its free icons for my social media and contact details.


## Media Screen
A media screen has been defined at 700px width in order to enable flexibility for smaller screens / mobile devices.

## End Result
As a result, I was able to build a simple to navigate website where icons, menu options and projects all have hover over effects to highlight them and the color scheme is uniform all accross. 

Here are some screenshots of the deployed site:
